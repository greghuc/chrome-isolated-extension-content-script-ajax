    <h1>Test runner</h1>
    <h2>What's going on</h2>
    <p>We're testing web-request interception for an iframe-loaded web-page (iframe.src=url), and ajax calls made inside that web-page.
        Specifically, we're checking that the reported tabId and frameId match, in both types of web-request.
    </p>
    <p>
       Opening this web-page triggers the tests. An iframe is created, either on the extension's background page, or on a visible tab. The iframe loads a web-page, which makes
        an ajax call. Both web-requests are intercepted using a chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest listener.
    </p>
    <p>For both intercepted web-requests, we expect the tabId and frameId to match. To see if this happened:
        <ul>
            <li>From the Chrome extensions page, view the extension console log using: 'Inspect views: background page'. Web-request details are output there</li>
            <li>Or, look at the 'Outcome' and 'Status' and sections below. They should be updated once the tests has run.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Chrome 50 behaves as expected: tabId and frameId match for all requests.</p>
